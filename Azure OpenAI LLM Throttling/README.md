Structured LLM throttling covers three main classes involved in managing LLM calls: 
LLMInitializer, LLMHandler, and LLMLogger.

# üîÑ LLM Throttling System Overview
In high-volume applications interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs), it's crucial to enforce rate limits, manage resource usage, and ensure fault-tolerant behavior. This is accomplished through a well-architected throttling system composed of three main components:

## 1. ‚öôÔ∏è LLMInitializer: Configuration & Setup
This class is responsible for initializing the LLM environment with appropriate throttling policies and parameters.

Responsibilities:
Load API keys, base URLs, and retry/backoff strategies.

Configure rate limit policies (e.g., max requests per minute).

Initialize any required queue or token bucket mechanism for throttling.

## 2. üß† LLMHandler: Core Interaction & Throttling Logic
This class handles the actual invocation of the LLM. It enforces throttling behavior during runtime and retries calls if rate limits are hit.

Responsibilities:
Check if the call is allowed (via rate limiter).

Queue or delay requests when threshold is reached.

Retry on transient failures (HTTP 429 or 5xx).

Interface with the LLM API (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI).

## 3. üìë LLMLogger: Logging & Metrics
This class logs all activity related to throttling, API usage, errors, and retry behavior. It‚Äôs vital for monitoring and observability.

Responsibilities:
Track API calls, response times, and usage volume.

Log throttle events (e.g., blocked or delayed requests).

Store metrics for alerts and dashboards.
