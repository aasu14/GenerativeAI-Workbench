# 🎥 Cinematic Multi-AI Agent Studio
Recreate the magic of filmmaking from concept to visuals using specialized AI agents.

This project simulates a futuristic film studio pipeline powered entirely by intelligent agents—each with a dedicated creative role. From ideation to visualization, agents collaborate to produce an immersive cinematic experience.

## 🧠 Objective
Build a Cinematic Multi-AI Agent System where each agent acts as a film professional, contributing creatively and technically to a cohesive production pipeline.

## 🎭 Agent Roles
✍️ Writer Agent
Generates the cinematic concept, including:

Title

Genre

Synopsis

Main characters

🎬 Director Agent
Crafts a key scene from the story—usually emotional, dramatic, or pivotal.

🖼️ Visualizer Agent
Produces visuals based on:

The Writer Agent's concept

The Director Agent’s scene

🛠️ Editor Agent

🔁 System Pipeline
The system should ensure seamless communication between agents through a well-orchestrated pipeline. Example flow:

sql
Copy
Edit
Writer Agent → Director Agent → Visualizer Agent → Editor Agent → Final Output
Agents may also loop back and refine their outputs collaboratively.

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria
Projects will be judged on:

🧠 Creativity – Originality and richness of storytelling and visuals
